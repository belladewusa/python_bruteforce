# python_bruteforce
Its just simple bruteforce scheme using Python. I use MD5 but you can change to another hashing algorithm if you want. Make sure you have strong hardware because its need more than a little netbook.

**How to use?**

Just clone and run it by: **python bruteforce.py** in your computer.

**Config**

stock_list = stock_list is a list of letters and numbers that will be combine to bruteforce. You can change it if you want.
xrange parameter = xrange parameter in line 15 is the lenght of password that will be generate to bruteforce. You can change it if you want.
